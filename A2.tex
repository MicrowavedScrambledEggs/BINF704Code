	\section{Accuracy of parameter estimation for logistic model of association:}
	
	\paragraph{}The logistic model is a way of modelling the association between two alleles (ie $A$ and $a$) at a locus and a binary phenotype (i.e trait that is either absent or present). It is described as follows: \\
	$p_g =$ probability that an individual of genotype $g$ has the trait. $g \in \{0,1,2\}$ assigned to genotypes $AA$, $Aa$ and $aa$ respectively. \\
	Log odds for $g = \log(\frac{p_g}{1 - p_g}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 g$
